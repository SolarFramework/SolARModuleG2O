**SolARModuleG2o** is a module to aggregates components dedicated to [bundle ajustement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustment) optimization based on [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library. g2o is licenced under [LGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).

g2o is an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. g2o has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be specified in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA.
